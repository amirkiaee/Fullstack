# Phase 1 – Learning Basic HTML & CSS (7–10 Days)

## Purpose

This phase focuses on learning the core building blocks of the web.

The goal is to understand how web pages are structured (HTML) and styled (CSS), without using any frameworks or preprocessors.

By the end of this phase, I should be able to build simple, clean, static web pages using semantic HTML and modern CSS, following best practices.
