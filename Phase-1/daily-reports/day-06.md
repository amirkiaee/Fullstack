# Day 06 – 2026‑02‑21

## 📌 Focus of the Day

- Practice advanced CSS selectors using internal CSS
- Understand selector behavior based on element position and attributes

## 📚 What I Learned

- Universal Selector (`*`)

- Apply styles to all elements globally.

- OR Selector (`,`)

- Style multiple different elements with one rule.

- AND Selector (combined selectors)

- Target elements more precisely using `tag + class`.

- General Sibling Selector (`~`)

- Style all sibling elements that come after a specific element.

- Adjacent Sibling Selector (`+`)

- Style only the immediate next sibling.

- Attribute Selectors

- Target elements based on attributes and patterns:

- Exact match (`=`)
- Starts with (`^`)
- Ends with (`$`)
- Contains (`*`)

## 🛠️ Practice

- Example4.html added in the html folder as the practice file.

- Each selector tested separately using internal CSS and one‑line comments.

## 🧠 Key Takeaway

- CSS selectors are powerful tools for precise targeting

- understanding their logic makes complex styling much easier.

## ✅ Tomorrow’s Plan

✅ Tomorrow’s Plan

- Pseudo‑classes

* box-sizing: border-box; (inner padding behavior)

- CSS priority & specificity(!important > inline style > #id > .class > tag > \*)
- Naming conventions

* Camel Case
* Pascal Case
* BEM (Block – Element – Modifier)

- CSS Positioning

* static
* relative
* absolute
* fixed
* sticky
